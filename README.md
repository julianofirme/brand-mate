# BrandMate

A modern web application designed for collaborative branding discussions, enabling users to upload and interact with PDF documents in real-time using AI. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and integrated with Groq API for intelligent, context-aware branding insights. BrandMate streamlines branding strategies by automatically extracting key details from documents and facilitating focused, interactive conversations.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- PDF document processing and chunking
- Vector-based semantic search using ChromaDB
- Interactive Chat Interface
- AI-Powered Document Analysis with Llama 3.3 70B
- Efficient document chunking with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
- Context-Aware Responses
- Real-time Processing

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Docker (for Qdrant)
- [Groq](groq.com) API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash

3. **Vector Storage**: Document chunks are embedded and stored in Qdrant for efficient retrieval
4. **Chat Interface**: Users can ask questions about the uploaded document
5. **AI Processing**: The application uses Llama 3.3 70B to generate context-aware responses based on the document content
